# Video-surveillance-system
A network video monitoring system based on Zybo board
The system uses Xilinx's Zybo development board as the core. It carries an embedded Linux operating system on the chip and transplants the network programming video capture and transmission program to the system to provide real-time video surveillance for both fixed and mobile clients. Due to the combination of embedded technology and network technology, the system has the advantages of simple structure, easy development, and high cost performance.
The article mainly includes five parts, first introduces the development of network video surveillance technology, the research status and development trend at home and abroad; Second it introduces the overall design of the system, including the system structure, Zynq SoC, embedded Linux system selection; Third is the hardware part of the system, involving hardware preparation, cross-compilation environment configuration; Next is the system's network programming, including V4l2 technology capture video, video network transmission, etc.; Finally, the network video surveillance system verification and summary. The final experimental results show that the network video surveillance system designed in this paper is feasible and the experimental results meet the expected requirements.
